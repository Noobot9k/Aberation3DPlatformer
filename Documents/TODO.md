## Setting
Urban environment with weird digitized distortions.

## Art Style
Flat colors and simple textures. Not pixelated. Make a genuine effort to not make texture tiling obvious. Follow a color pallete.

## Design
* Collecting enough coins cause a level-specific spacial aberation thing to happen. (Something weird like gravity reversing.)
